Avoided Emissions - Offsite Green Power (Metric Tons CO2e),"Avoided Emissions are the emissions benefits associated with green power use. Avoided emissions may be either onsite or offsite.
Onsite Avoided Emissions are the emissions benefits of your onsite renewable system (when you’ve retained the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)) due to the reduction in grid-supplied electricity. It is calculated as the amount of Onsite Green Power you consume multiplied by the non-baseload (marginal) emissions factor of your eGRID subregion.
Offsite Avoided Emissions occur when you purchase green power (which come with RECs) from your utility or an independent supplier. Offsite Avoided Emissions also occur in the case of REC arbitrage, a transaction where you sell the RECs associated with your own onsite system and purchase other substitute RECs.

ENERGY STAR Score,"The ENERGY STAR Score is a measure of how well your property is performing relative to similar properties, when normalized for climate and operational characteristics.

The ENERGY STAR scores are based on data from national building energy consumption surveys, and this allows Portfolio Manager to control for key variables affecting a building’s energy performance, including climate, hours of operation, and building size. What this means is that buildings from around the country, with different operating parameters and subject to different weather patterns, can be compared side-by-side in order to see how they stack up in terms of energy performance. The specific factors that are included in this normalization (Hours, Workers, Climate, etc) will depend on the property type.

The 1-100 scale is set so that 1 represents the worst performing buildings and 100 represents the best performing buildings. A score of 50 indicates that a building is performing at the national median, taking into account its size, location, and operating parameters. A score of 75 indicates that a property is performing in the 75th percentile and may be eligible to earn ENERGY STAR Certification.

ENERGY STAR Scores are available for many property types.

The 1-100 scale is based on the country in which your property is located. Properties in the US are compared to the national population of properties in the US. Similarly, properties in Canada are compared to the national population of properties in Canada. At this time there are no ENERGY STAR scores specifically developed for other countries. Therefore, properties located in other countries will be compared to the US national population, by default.",1-100,,
Green Power - Offsite (kWh),"Green Power is a generic term for renewable energy sources and specific clean energy technologies that emit fewer GHG emissions relative to other sources of energy that supply the electric grid. You may use green power directly from an on-site renewable system, or you may purchase green power from your utility or independent green power supplier. In order for power to be considered green, you must own what are called the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), or the legal claims/rights to the environmental benefits of the green power. These rights can be sold separately from the actual electricity (kWh). Therefore, please note the following distinction between Onsite and Offsite Green Power:
Onsite Green Power – Power generated from an onsite renewable system. The only types of onsite green power currently tracked in Portfolio Manager are solar and wind power. Energy use from these systems is green only if you retain the rights to the RECs associated with the power generated by your system. If you sell the RECs (for example, through REC arbitrage), then you do not have onsite green power.
Offsite Green Power – Green power purchases from your utility and/or independent purchases of RECs. If through utility purchases you acquire both electricity (kWh) and RECs, then you have the right to the Green Power. If you purchase your electricity (kWh) from your utility but your RECs from another provider, then you may attribute these RECs to your utility power.

National Median ENERGY STAR Score,"The National Median is an extremely useful benchmark: 50% of properties perform below the median, and 50% perform above the median. It represents the middle of the national population. Most property types in Portfolio Manager get their National Median from the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). There are 5 exceptions where the National Median is not based on CBECS data: Data Centers, Hospitals, Multifamily, Senior Living Community, and Wastewater Treatment Plants",,,
National Median Site EUI (kBtu/ft²),"The exact way the National Median is determined depends on the property:
If your property has an ENERGY STAR score - The National Median Source EUI is the Source EUI that will give your specific property an ENERGY STAR score of 50. This means the National Median is normalized to account for your property's weather, business activity, and fuel mix. Using the National Median Source EUI, Portfolio Manager computes other National Median metrics like National Median Site EUI, National Median Energy Cost, and National Median GHG Emissions.
If your property has multiple scorable property types – the National Median is a calculated average based on the proportions of the National Medians of each property type (as calculated above).
If your property has both scorable and non-scorable property types (Office & Restaurant) - the National Median is based only on the scorable property type.
If your property does not have an ENERGY STAR score - The National Median is the Source EUI from CBECS, normalized for your property's specific fuel mix, but not normalization for either weather or business operations. Using the National Median Source EUI, Portfolio Manager computes other National Median metrics like National Median Site EUI, National Median Energy Cost, and National Median GHG Emissions.
If a property has multiple non-scorable property types (Social Hall 70%, Food Service 30%) – the National Median for comparison is the “Portfolio Manager-Calculated Property Type” (which is the property type that is over 51% of the GFA, in this example it would be Social Hall).

Occupancy,"Occupancy is the percentage of your property’s Gross Floor Area (GFA) that is occupied and operational. This is a measure of the building’s occupancy/use, it is not connected to a building’s “Maximum Occupancy.”

The value you enter for occupancy will not affect your ENERGY STAR Score or any other metrics. Your Score is based on your specific Use Details (Number of Workers, Computers, etc) and you need to update your Use Details to accurately reflect the activity at your property.

Your occupancy could affect your eligibility for ENERGY STAR certification. We have the following occupancy requirements:
Office/Bank/Courthouse/Financial Office – at least 55%
Hotel - at least 60%
Multifamily – at least 80%
If you are not seeking certification for one of the above property types, you may not find Occupancy very useful (though it is required, so enter your best guess and move on).Examples to help you determine your occupancy:
Office: Occupancy is a measure of the tenant spaces that are leased. If you have a 10-story building, and on average one floor is vacant, and the other 9 floors fully leased and occupied, then the occupancy would be 90%. If you have people working on all floors/areas of your building, then you are 100% occupied. You do not need to count empty cubicles or the number of employees who enter a property.
Hotel: Occupancy is a measure of the rooms that are sold. If you have a hotel with 100 rooms, and on average 10 rooms per night are vacant, then the occupancy is 90%.
Multifamily: Occupancy is a measure of the units that are leased. If you have a 100 apartments, and 5 are vacant for the year, then the occupancy is 95%.
Worship Facility: Occupancy is the percentage of the building that is operational, regardless of how many people are in the building. Most of the time, this will be 100%.
There is only one Occupancy rate for each property as a whole. You enter Occupancy when you first create the property, and you can change it on the Details tab. You cannot track occupancy changes over time.",Percent,,

Property ID,"Property IDs are unique identifiers for your property that can be used by EPA, you, or other organizations to track and manage your property. There are four main types of Property IDs:
Portfolio Manager Property IDs - This is a unique ID assigned by EPA to each property.
Portfolio Manager Parent Property IDs - If your property is a campus of buildings and you benchmark one or more ""child"" buildings individually, then each child building will be associated to its parent through this ID.
Custom IDs - A custom ID is an ID that you can set, for example, it could be an ID associated with your company or an ID for a campaign in which you are participating. When you enter a Custom ID, you can enter both a name for the ID and its actual value. For example: (Company ABC Inventory ID, 01234). When you search for these custom IDs in reports, you will see them only as Custom ID 1, Custom ID 2, and Custom ID 3, because Custom ID 1 could be different for different properties in your portfolio.
Standard IDs - A standard ID is a special type of ID with a set name that is available within Portfolio Manager. These are IDs associated with local legislation, national campaigns, or other large benchmarking activities. For example, New York City uses the Borough Block and Lot (BBL) number to track buildings in their jurisdiction. To enter a standard ID you can select the ID name from our dropdown list and then enter the value. See Standard ID for a full list.",,,
Site Energy Use (kBtu),"The annual amount of all the energy your property consumes on-site, regardless of the source.

For example, if you are looking at the period ending December 2008, this metric would tell you the amount of Source Energy you would have used in 2008 if your operating conditions (weather, hours, occupants) had been the same as they are for your current time period. Much like looking at financial investments in the dollars for a specific year, this adjusted value will help you understand the change in energy when accounting for changes in operation. Adjusted Source EUI is also available (i.e. Adjusted Source Energy divided by property size or by flow through a water/wastewater treatment plant).",kBtu,,
Source EUI (kBtu/ft²)," Source EUI (Energy Use Intensity) is Source Energy divided by the property's Gross Floor Area.

Weather Normalized Source EUI is also available (i.e. Weather Normalized Source Energy divided by property size or by flow through a water/wastewater treatment plant).",kBtu/ft²,,
